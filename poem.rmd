'I've a pain in my head'  
Said the suffering Beckford;  
To her Doctor so dread.
'Oh! what shall I take for't?'  

Said this Doctor so dread  
Whose name it was Newnham.  
'For this pain in your head  
Ah! What can you do Ma'am?'  

Said Miss Beckford, 'Suppose  
If you think there's no risk,  
I take a good Dose  
Of calomel brisk.'--
